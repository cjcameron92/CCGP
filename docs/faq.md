# FAQ
### What is the purpose of the provided Python script?
The script is designed to implement a Genetic Programming (GP) approach using the carvalhogp library to evolve mathematical expressions or models that best fit a given set of data points. It leverages linear regression to evaluate the fitness of individual models.

### How do I get started with using this script?
To begin, ensure you have all necessary libraries installed, including carvalhogp, sklearn, numpy, matplotlib, and scipy. You will also need to have Python installed on your system. Download the script and the required data file points.arff, and run the script in a Python environment.

### What does the multi_gene_fitness function do?
This function evaluates the fitness of an individual in the genetic population. It takes a set of genes (mathematical expressions), applies them to input data points, and uses linear regression to model the relationship. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted outputs and actual values is returned as the fitness score.

### How are the genetic operations defined in the script?
Genetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined along with trigonometric functions sine, cosine, and tangent. These operations are used to construct and manipulate the genes within the genetic algorithm.

### What are the main variables I might need to adjust?
Variables such as pop_size (population size), num_genes (number of genes per individual), mutation_rate, crossover_rate, and num_generations are key parameters that can be adjusted according to the specific needs of the problem being addressed.

### How is the data read and processed?
Data is read from an ARFF file using the scipy.io.arff module. The readData function processes this data into a format suitable for the GP algorithm, including decoding byte strings if necessary.

### What is the output of the script?
The script outputs the statistics of genetic programming runs, including average, minimum, maximum, and median fitness across generations. It also saves plots depicting these statistics over generations. Additionally, the script identifies the best individual model from the runs and prints details about its fitness and mathematical expression.

### How can I visualize the results?
The script automatically generates and saves plots of average, minimum, and median fitness over generations in the specified directory. These plots help in visualizing the progress and effectiveness of the genetic programming process over time.

### What should I do if I encounter errors related to missing libraries or other runtime issues?
Ensure all the required libraries are installed correctly. If errors persist, check the Python and library versions to ensure compatibility. Consult the documentation of the individual libraries for more detailed troubleshooting.
